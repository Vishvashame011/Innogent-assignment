Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language that was
developed by Sun Microsystems and later acquired by Oracle. It follows the principle of “write once,
run anywhere,” which means that once you write Java code, it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
This makes Java one of the most portable and reliable languages used today. It is widely used in web applications,
desktop software, backend services, and Android app development. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
making it easier for developers familiar with those languages to learn Java quickly.

One of the main features of Java is its strong memory management system,
which includes automatic garbage collection to free unused memory. Java supports multithreading,
allowing multiple tasks to execute concurrently, which improves performance in applications like games,
servers, and simulations.

The language also emphasizes security and exception handling to ensure stable and safe code execution.
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM.
This architecture ensures that the same program can run on Windows, Linux, or macOS without modification.
Java has a vast ecosystem that includes powerful frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX,
making it suitable for building complex enterprise-level applications.
The Collections Framework in Java provides data structures like List, Set, and Map, making data management easier.

With Java 8, new features like the Stream API, lambda expressions, and the Optional class were introduced,
making functional programming possible in Java.
The introduction of method references and the CompletableFuture class improved asynchronous and parallel programming capabilities.
Java also supports annotations for metadata, reflection for runtime inspection, and synchronization for thread safety.
Its Executors framework and ForkJoinPool allow efficient handling of parallel tasks. Overall, Java’s stability, versatility,
and vast library support make it one of the most powerful and developer-friendly languages ever created.
